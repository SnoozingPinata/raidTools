Stand in melee range behind XT's left foot.

If you get:
  - Light bomb - Run to the right and get 8 yards away from everyone else. Don't run through the raid if you happen to get this while you're on the left!
  - Gravity Bomb - Run to the left of the raid, this drops a kill circle so stand next to the other black circles when it's ticking off. Min 20 yards from raid.

Pop CD's during tantrum (happens every 60 seconds).

When heart is open:
  - Ranged: Kill bomb bots and repair bots before they're in range of the raid.
  - Tank: Pickup Pummelers.
